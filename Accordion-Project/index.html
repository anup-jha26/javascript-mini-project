            <div class="accordion-body">
                The Sun is so massive that about 1.3 million Earths could fit inside it. It accounts for 99.8% of our
                solar system's total mass.

            <div class="accordion-body">
                A single day on Venus is longer than its year! Venus rotates very slowly, taking 243 Earth days to

            <div class="accordion-body">
                Saturnâ€™s rings are made mostly of ice and rock. They are incredibly thin, often less than 1 kilometer
                thick despite their massive width.
